# run-spaceapp

Cross-platform Docker launcher for SpaceApp.

Run the same command in Linux, macOS, or Windows 11 Command Prompt:

```bash
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest install
```

To keep a global `spaceapp` command for later operations, install it
separately:

```bash
npm install -g run-spaceapp
```

The launcher requires Node.js 20.11 or newer, 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 15 GiB free
disk. Keep `@latest` in the command so npm resolves the current release instead
of matching an existing local launcher. If Docker is missing, the universal
install command automatically installs it from official Docker sources on
Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS, starts it, and waits
for Engine and Compose readiness before pulling images. Windows prefers
Windows Package Manager's hash-pinned Docker Desktop
manifest and retains a signed direct-download fallback. Docker Desktop license
acceptance and Linux `docker` group membership require confirmation inside the
same command. On Windows, approve any UAC prompt required by WSL2 or Docker
Desktop. Use the **Command Prompt** profile because a restricted PowerShell
policy can block npm's `npx.ps1` before SpaceApp starts. On Docker Desktop's
first launch, select **Skip** in the top-right of the **Welcome to Docker**
window (or sign in), accept any remaining Docker prompt, and keep the terminal
open. SpaceApp waits for up to ten minutes and continues automatically when
Docker is ready. If WSL2 requires one restart, SpaceApp registers a one-time
resume and asks before scheduling it. Sign back in after Windows restarts; the
same install continues automatically in Command Prompt without entering a
second command.

The launcher defaults to the `light` profile on every system. Run
`npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest install --profile standard` explicitly when
managed Chromium is required and the host has the recommended resources.

Light mode retains every bundled CLI and the core data/workflow services while
omitting managed Chromium. Resource limits are maximums, not immediate RAM or
disk reservations. The launcher stores only non-secret configuration in the
current user's platform config directory:

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spaceapp` or `$HOME/.config/spaceapp`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/SpaceApp`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\SpaceApp`

Set `SPACEAPP_HOME` to an absolute path to use a dedicated installation root.

Provider API keys are read from masked standard input and written to
restrictive files outside Git. OAuth and device-code credentials remain in
isolated Docker provider state. Neither credential source is included in
portable SpaceApp backups.

Claude Code is not redistributed in SpaceApp images. Install the reviewed
package as an explicit owner action with:

```bash
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest provider install claude
```

Run `npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest help` for the complete command list. Full

After the stack passes readiness checks, the install command prints the fresh
15-minute token to paste into the browser's **One-time setup token** field. If
it expires before the owner is created, run:

```bash
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest owner rotate-setup-token
```

Common follow-up commands use the same reliable launcher prefix:

```bash
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest doctor
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest status
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest credentials list
npx --yes run-spaceapp@latest uninstall
```

Uninstall retains data by default and prints the separate
`npm uninstall -g run-spaceapp` command for removing an optional global
launcher.
